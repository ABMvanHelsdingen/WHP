# IWP

# Bayesian.R: code to run Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chain in the R package NIMBLE. Fits cue data to model with intensity given by Equation 8

# Frequentist.R: code to fit cue data to model by MLE in the R package TMB. 

# IWPSimulations.R: runs simulation studies with user-defined parameters. Written to be run in parallel on NeSI server. 

# weibull_hawkes.cpp: TMB template for "vanilla" Weibull-Hawkes model, used by IWPSimulations.R

# whale_cues.cpp: TMB template for whale cue model, used by Frequentist.R
